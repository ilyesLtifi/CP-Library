My implementations' library of the Algorithms and Data Structures I use in Competitive Programming.

These are all well tested against hundreds of problems each having tens of tests.

Implemented as classes/structs to allow as much generic use as possible and to minimize bugs when importing in problem solving competitions.

I have also implemented some random generator tools to quickly make test cases and stress test my solutions(with bash scripts).

They do not include basics such as BFS, DFS, regular queues.. but they do include:

- Data Structures
  - Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
  - Segment Tree
  - Sparse Table
  - AVL Tree
  - Ordered Set (On top of C++'s Red Black Tree)

- Graphs
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Floyd's Algorithm
  - Lowest Common Ancestor
  - Disjoint Set Union (DSU / UnionFind)
  - Centroid Decomposition
  - Heavy-Light Decomposition
  - Tarjan's Algorithm
  - A Graph class (can be suitable for some problems where you work with multiple graphs, edges are still implemented as adjacency lists)

- Network Flows
  - Dinic's Max-Flow Algorithm
  
- String Processing
  - Z Algorithm
  - Trie
  - Hashing class
  
- Maths Algorithms
  - BigInteger class
  - Fast Fourier Transform
  - Sieve of Eratosthenes
  - Chinese Remainder Theorem
  - Other math helper functions (modulo arithmetic)
  
- Geometry Algorithms
  - Vector/Point class (with tons of algorithms that help easy geometry implementations, even with polygon and circle algorithms)
  - Convex Hull

- Misc
  - Quicksort
  - Mergesort
  - Longest Increasing Subsequence
  - Knapsack
  - Matrix Exponentiation
  - Unordered Map implementation(safer and faster than C++'s standard one)
