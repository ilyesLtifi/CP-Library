/**
* The Disjoint set data structure(a unionâ€“find data structure)
* is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets
* It stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets
* The operations it provides are: adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union),
* and finding a representative member of a set.
* It is key in Kruskal's Minimum/Maximum Spanning Tree algorithm
* Its complexity(and its fast speed) depends on the Inverse Ackermann function, see wiki for more detail.
